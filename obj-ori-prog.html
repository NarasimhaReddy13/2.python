OOP --- Object Oriented Programming

Software -- Easily changeable tool that performs specific task ( Softness )

OOPSystem -- is a way of approaching, designing, developing software that is easy to change and resembles real-life objects

Bad Way of describing -- information scattering, unrecognized
Organized description -- Clear separation of objects, clear grouping of what object has and what it does



When we are describing same objects only with different values for properties :? Use Template ( Standard Form )

When modelling real-life objects -- we ensure to bundle related info together to clearly separate info of different objects

Bundling related info (properties & actions together) -- is Encapsulation - Classes are used to bundle props and actions

class keyword ---- is used to create a class --- class ClassName:  
In Python, special method ---   def __init__   --- is used to assign values to properties

In OOP -- 
        properties are called attributes ***
        actions are called methods ***


To use the defined class -- we have to instantaite it
As class is like Blueprint --- while its instance is based on that class with actual values


Instance of class is similar to function call -- This instance is called Object ***

Class Object is simply a collection of attributes and methods that act on thode data 

Similar to Functions -- methods also support positional, keyword, default args and also return values 

For instance method, we need to first write self in function definition and then other arguments **

The class from which object is created is considered to be type of object --- type(obj1)

Attributes can be set or accessed using . (dot) notation
We can also access and update properties in other methods

It is recommended to update attributes through methods.



Attributes -:--- Broadly 2 types 
    Instance Attributes : Attributes whose values can differ for each instance of class are modelled ( Items in cart )
    Class Attributes: Attributes whose values stay common for all the objects are modelled ( Min bill, Flat Discount )


Instance Attributes :-- Can only be accessed using instance of class


Methods:
Instance Methods -:-- can access all attributes of the instance and have self as a parameter
                      Can be accessed through object ( instance of class )

Class Methods* -:-- We send cls as a parameter indicating we are passing the class
                   @classmethod   -- decorator marks the method below it as a class method

Static Method* -:-- We might need some generic methods that don't need access to either instance or class attributes ( These are Static Methods )
                   @staticmethod   -- decorator

                   * ---- Can be accessed through class

Advantages of Modelling Classes :  Product , ElectronicItem + Product , GroceryItem + Product --:--
    Reusability, Clear separation, More Organized


Inheritance: Is a mechanism by which a class inherits attributes and methods from another class

ElectronicItem inherits attributes & methods from Product -- instead of defining them again

Product is Super/Base/Parent Class ---- ElectronicItem is Sub/Derived/Child Class
Sub Class automatically inherits all the attributes & methods from its superclass
Super Class cannot access the methods and attributes of the subclass


We can call methods defined in superclass from the methods in the subclass


Composition -:-- Modelling instances of one class as attributes of another class.

Sometimes, we require a method in the instances of a subclass to behave differently from the method in instance of a super class

super()  --- allows us to call methods of the superclass from subclass

We can also inherit from subclass -- Can continue such Inheritance to any depth ---- MultiLevel Inheritance

Inheritance ? when to use ---- When Classes have IS-A relationship.
Composition ? when to use ---- When Classes have HAS-A relationship




OOP Usage --- To build well-organized systems that are easy to use and extend ( to read easily , to fix bugs )
